# PaymentSystemEmulator

I welcome everyone to use my source code to create own Weather Bot.

There are several things I direct for **all developers** for the moment.

# Guide

1. Clone the project from GitHub (*Windows compatibility*):

```
git clone --recursive -j8 https://github.com/LaDoring/PaymentSystemEmulator
```
2. Adjust configuration parameters:
- Modify the values in localhost, login and password data in main.go
- Modify the values of DB and tables on your own in main.go

3. (Optional) You may start the app on the local host:
```
> go run main.go
```
4. ALso test the API with written test_main.py
